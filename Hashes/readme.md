List of Hashes obtained from:\
https://virusshare.com/hashes

There are a total of 1892475 packed and unpacked hashes. Each shelf has ~49081 packed and unpacked hashes.\
The reason for this is GitHub's maximum file size of 25 MB. The .dat file for a shelve containing all 1892475 pairs of hashes is upwards of 946 MB alone.

Yes I accidentally named the files "mdf" and not "md5". Sorry
