# .github Directory 

## Purpose
* This directory is meant to store / house all the boring github files, that can be generated by github (more often than not generated by github), to increase transparency and make it more accessible to anyone who might be interested in contributing.

* **NOTE** that the `(ROOT) README.md` and `LICENSE` should stay in the root directory and not be put into .github.
